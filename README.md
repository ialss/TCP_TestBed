Hi viewer! This repo is a test bed for some of the TCP communication work I did. 
This was a way for me to play around with TCP communcations. 
This program allows for messages to be sent between a client and a server and vice versa. 

If you want to run the program yourself run the server file first (THIS IS A MUST!) and then in another terminal/enviroment run the client package. 
Currently this is configured to run locally using my own ports. The adresses and ports must be changed on your hand if you want to run this in anyway but locally.
